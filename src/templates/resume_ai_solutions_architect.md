## ARCHITECTURE EXPERTISE

### AI/ML System Design
- **LLM Orchestration:** Multi-model routing (Claude, GPT, Groq) based on task requirements
- **Agent Architecture:** Autonomous pipelines with inter-agent communication
- **Memory Systems:** Persistent context via Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **RAG Pipelines:** Document retrieval and contextual generation

### Infrastructure & Cloud
- **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI):** Autonomous Database, VM instances, startup credits
- **Railway:** Containerized deployment, auto-scaling
- **Docker:** Containerization for all production services
- **PM2:** Process management, zero-downtime deployment

### Enterprise Integrations
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, Oracle Autonomous Database 26ai (mTLS encryption)
- **APIs:** REST, WebSocket, GitHub webhooks
- **Security:** mTLS, credential scanning, OAuth2

## ARCHITECTED SYSTEMS

### 🏗️ AI Co-Founder Pipeline (CTO + CMO Integration)
**Challenge:** Build autonomous AI agents that collaborate without human intervention

**Architecture:**
```
[GitHub PR] → CTO AIPA (code review) → [Decision: pass/fail]
                    ↓
              [REST notification]
                    ↓
            CMO AIPA (content) → [LinkedIn post]
```

**Technical Decisions:**
- **CTO AIPA:** TypeScript for type safety, Groq for speed (<30s reviews), Claude for critical analysis
- **CMO AIPA:** Python/FastAPI for rapid iteration, Make.com for multi-platform distribution
- **Database:** Oracle Autonomous DB with mTLS for secure PR metadata storage
- **Hosting:** Oracle Cloud (CTO) + Railway (CMO) for cost optimization

**Results:**
- $0/month operational cost
- 24/7 autonomous operation
- 100% PR coverage, zero missed reviews

### 🏗️ EspaLuz — Multi-Channel AI Tutor
**Challenge:** Emotionally intelligent tutor with persistent memory across WhatsApp, Telegram, and Web

**Architecture:**
- **Gateway Layer:** WhatsApp Cloud API + Telegram Bot API + Web endpoints
- **Orchestration:** FastAPI with async handlers
- **AI Layer:** GPT-4 for conversation, Whisper for voice, OCR for images
- **Memory:** MCP-based persistent context per user/family
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with session state and learning progress

**Technical Decisions:**
- Model Context Protocol for cross-session memory (vs stateless ChatGPT)
- Railway deployment with auto-restart for 99%+ uptime
- PayPal webhook integration for subscription management

**Results:**
- Paying users across 19 countries
- Bilingual (EN/ES) with cultural context awareness
- Family accounts with shared memory

---

### 🏗️ ALGOM Alpha — Autonomous Trading Agent
**Challenge:** Real-time market analysis with educational content generation

**Architecture:**
- **Framework:** ElizaOS (autonomous AI agent platform)
- **Data:** CCXT for 5 exchange integrations, WebSocket for real-time prices
- **Analysis:** Technical indicators (MA, RSI, Bollinger)
- **Distribution:** Twitter API v2 for autonomous posting
