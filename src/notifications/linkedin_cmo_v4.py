THE CHALLENGE:
Build AI agents that work WITHOUT human intervention—true autonomy.

THE AIPA STACK:
• ALGOM Alpha (X/Twitter): Node.js + ElizaOS + Claude + CCXT
  → Autonomous paper trading + educational content
  → 180+ followers, posting daily, zero manual work

• VibeJobHunter: Python + Claude + Selenium + Make.com
  → Autonomous job hunting + outreach automation
  → Finds jobs, researches companies, sends personalized messages

• EspaLuz Influencer (LinkedIn/IG): Python + GPT-4 + Buffer + Make.com
  → Automated content generation + multi-platform posting
  → Bilingual (EN/ES) emotional AI stories

• EspaLuz WhatsApp + Telegram: Python + Claude + Twilio
  → Autonomous AI tutors for language learning
  → 24/7 emotional support, 19 countries

THE SOLUTION:
1. Railway for hosting (continuous deployment from GitHub)
2. Telegram for real-time monitoring (get alerts on my phone)
3. Robust error handling + exponential backoff retries
4. Cost optimization (smart caching, API batching)
5. Comprehensive logging (debug in production)

THE RESULT:
• 99.9% uptime for 3+ months
• ~$100/month hosting cost (vs $20K+/month for human team)
• Truly hands-off operation

KEY INSIGHT:
Autonomous doesn't mean "set and forget"—it means "intelligent self-healing."

The agents detect failures, retry with backoff, send me Telegram alerts for critical issues, and keep running even when APIs are temporarily down.

7 months ago: CEO & CLO in E-Government (Russia), ZERO coding experience
Today: 9 live AI products, 5 autonomous AIPAs running 24/7, users in 19 countries

This wasn't a "career pivot" — it was a complete rebuild.

What I started with:
• Ex-CEO/CLO credentials (but no technical background)
• M.A. in Social Psychology (understanding humans, not machines)
• <$15K budget (no funding, no team)
• Urgency (relocated to Panama, had to rebuild from zero)

What I built:
✅ 9 AI products (full-stack, solo)
✅ 5 AIPAs running autonomously 24/7
✅ AI-assisted vibe coding (urgency + AI = execution speed)

What I shipped (9 AI products):

🤖 5 AIPAs (Autonomous AI Personal Assistants):
• EspaLuz WhatsApp - AI Tutor running 24/7 (Railway)
• EspaLuz Telegram - AI Tutor running 24/7 (Railway)
• EspaLuz Influencer - Content automation (Railway)
• ALGOM Alpha - Crypto trading agent (Railway, 180+ followers)
• VibeJobHunter - Job hunting automation (Railway)

🚀 4 Other AI Products:
• EspaLuz Web SaaS - AI Tutor platform (Lovable.dev)
• ATUONA NFT Gallery - Poetry on Polygon (Fleek)
• AIdeazz Website - Ecosystem showroom (Fleek)
• AIdeazz Docs - Complete documentation (GitHub)

All deployed, all live, all autonomous!

Tech stack I learned:
• Languages: Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, SQL
• AI: Claude, GPT-4, Whisper, TTS, OCR, ElizaOS
• Frameworks: React, Flask, Node.js, FastAPI
• Infra: Railway, Lovable.dev, Fleek (IPFS), PostgreSQL
• Web3: Polygon, Thirdweb, MetaMask, IPFS

KEY INSIGHT:
You don't need a team to build—you need AI agents working FOR you.

The insight: You don't need a CS degree to build AI products. You need founder-level urgency + AI tooling + relentless execution.

I went from executive to engineer because I HAD to. Relocated to Panama, rebuilt from zero, and discovered that vision + urgency + AI = unstoppable.

Now open to: Founding Engineer roles where I bring this 0→1 speed + founder mindset to early-stage AI startups.

Not job hunting. Building leverage.

In 2022, I relocated to Panama. Zero Spanish. Zero team. Zero investments. Ex-CEO who had never written a line of code.

I had to rebuild my entire life from scratch.

So I started building AI products—not to scam anyone, not to fake skills, but to SURVIVE and TRANSFORM:

🇪🇸 EspaLuz — Because I needed to learn Spanish to integrate into my new country
🔍 VibeJobHunter — Because I needed a serious role, not 100 copy-paste applications
🤖 CTO AIPA — Because I had no technical co-founder to review my code
📣 CMO AIPA — Because I had no marketing team but needed to build in public
📚 ALGOM Alpha — Because I wanted to teach crypto safely after the scam era
🎨 Atuona — Because poetry was my therapy during transformation

Every single product in my AIdeazz ecosystem solves a REAL problem in MY journey.

This is what vibe coding means to me:

💡 It's not a shortcut—it's a SURVIVAL STRATEGY
💡 It's not replacing skills—it's BUILDING NEW ONES under pressure
💡 It's not hiding behind AI—it's PARTNERING with AI to do what one person couldn't

11 products. 10 months. Solo. <$15K.

🎯 WHY I'M TRANSPARENT ABOUT USING VIBEJOBHUNTER:

Yes, my AI agent sends applications. But here's what it actually sends:
• MY code (I built the entire system)
• MY strategy (I designed the scoring algorithms)
• MY judgment (I calibrated what "good fit" means)
• MY resume variants (I wrote all 3)
• MY personalization prompts (I crafted them)

The AI is the vehicle. I am the architect.

I'm not here to grab money with AI hallucinations.
I'm not here to ship foolish products that serve nobody.
I'm not here to fake expertise I don't have.

I'm here because I rebuilt my life with AI—and that IS the expertise.

🧠 WHAT I ACTUALLY WANT:

✅ A serious role with real compensation
✅ To be part of a real team building real products
✅ To bring 0→1 speed to people who value builders
✅ To continue my transformation—not fake one

If you're looking for someone who can build autonomous systems that actually work in production, who understands both the technical AND the human side of AI—I'm that person.

And yes, I'm completely transparent about how I got here.

Hoy: 9 productos de IA en vivo, 5 AIPAs autónomos funcionando 24/7, usuarios en 19 países

Esto no fue un "cambio de carrera" — fue una reconstrucción completa.

Con qué empecé:
• Credenciales Ex-CEO/CLO (pero sin background técnico)
• M.A. en Psicología Social (entendiendo humanos, no máquinas)
• Presupuesto <$15K (sin financiamiento, sin equipo)
• Urgencia (reubicada en Panamá, tenía que reconstruir desde cero)

Lo que construí:
✅ 9 productos de IA (full-stack, sola)
✅ 5 AIPAs funcionando autónomamente 24/7
✅ Vibe coding asistido por IA (urgencia + IA = velocidad de ejecución)

🤖 5 AIPAs (Asistentes Personales de IA Autónomos):
• EspaLuz WhatsApp - Tutor de IA 24/7 (Railway)
• EspaLuz Telegram - Tutor de IA 24/7 (Railway)

• Lenguajes: Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, SQL
• IA: Claude, GPT-4, Whisper, TTS, OCR, ElizaOS
• Frameworks: React, Flask, Node.js, FastAPI
• Infraestructura: Railway, Lovable.dev, Fleek (IPFS), PostgreSQL

INSIGHT CLAVE:
No necesitas un equipo para construir—necesitas agentes de IA trabajando PARA ti.

El insight: No necesitas un título en CS para construir productos de IA. Necesitas urgencia nivel fundador + herramientas de IA + ejecución implacable.

Pasé de ejecutiva a ingeniera porque TENÍA que hacerlo. Me reubiqué en Panamá, reconstruí desde cero, y descubrí que visión + urgencia + IA = imparable.

Ahora abierta a: Roles de Founding Engineer donde traigo esta velocidad 0→1 + mentalidad fundadora a startups de IA en fase inicial.

No busco trabajo. Construyo leverage.

En 2022, me reubiqué en Panamá. Cero español. Cero equipo. Cero inversiones. Ex-CEO que nunca había escrito una línea de código.

Tuve que reconstruir mi vida entera desde cero.

Así que empecé a construir productos de IA—no para estafar a nadie, no para fingir habilidades, sino para SOBREVIVIR y TRANSFORMARME:

🇪🇸 EspaLuz — Porque necesitaba aprender español para integrarme en mi nuevo país
🔍 VibeJobHunter — Porque necesitaba un rol serio, no 100 aplicaciones de copiar y pegar
🤖 CTO AIPA — Porque no tenía cofundador técnico para revisar mi código
📣 CMO AIPA — Porque no tenía equipo de marketing pero necesitaba construir en público
📚 ALGOM Alpha — Porque quería enseñar cripto de forma segura después de la era de estafas
🎨 Atuona — Porque la poesía era mi terapia durante la transformación

Cada producto en mi ecosistema AIdeazz resuelve un problema REAL en MI camino.

Esto es lo que vibe coding significa para mí:

💡 No es un atajo—es una ESTRATEGIA DE SUPERVIVENCIA
💡 No es reemplazar habilidades—es CONSTRUIR NUEVAS bajo presión
💡 No es esconderse detrás de IA—es ASOCIARSE con IA para hacer lo que una persona sola no podría

11 productos. 10 meses. Sola. <$15K.

🎯 POR QUÉ SOY TRANSPARENTE SOBRE USAR VIBEJOBHUNTER:

Sí, mi agente de IA envía aplicaciones. Pero esto es lo que realmente envía:
• MI código (construí todo el sistema)
• MI estrategia (diseñé los algoritmos de puntuación)
• MI juicio (calibré lo que significa "buen fit")
• MIS variantes de CV (escribí las 3)
• MIS prompts de personalización (los creé)

La IA es el vehículo. Yo soy la arquitecta.

No estoy aquí para agarrar dinero con alucinaciones de IA.
No estoy aquí para lanzar productos tontos que no sirven a nadie.
No estoy aquí para fingir experiencia que no tengo.

Estoy aquí porque reconstruí mi vida con IA—y ESA es la experiencia.

🧠 LO QUE REALMENTE QUIERO:

✅ Un rol serio con compensación real
✅ Ser parte de un equipo real construyendo productos reales
✅ Llevar velocidad 0→1 a personas que valoran a los builders
✅ Continuar mi transformación—no fingir una

Si buscas a alguien que pueda construir sistemas autónomos que realmente funcionen en producción, que entienda tanto el lado técnico COMO el humano de la IA—soy esa persona.

Y sí, soy completamente transparente sobre cómo llegué aquí.
