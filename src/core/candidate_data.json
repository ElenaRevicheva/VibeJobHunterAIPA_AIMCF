What excites me most is building products that solve real problems - like my WhatsApp AI assistant that's live today at wa.me/50766623757. I'm looking for a role where I can use both my strategic experience and technical skills to build AI products that help millions of people.",

Your focus on [their mission] aligns perfectly with my experience building products for underserved markets.",
    
    "biggest_achievement": "Building 6 production AI applications in 7 months for under $15K - a 98% cost reduction vs the $950K traditional estimate. But beyond the metrics, I'm most proud that these are real, working products solving real problems. You can try one right now: wa.me/50766623757.

    "technical_challenge": "Integrating 8 different AI APIs with real-time voice processing was complex. The challenge was handling voice-to-text latency, API failures, and maintaining conversation context. I solved it by building a robust error handling system with fallbacks, implementing streaming responses, and creating a context management layer. The result is a production system that handles real-time voice conversations with 99%+ uptime.",
    
    "why_leave_current_role": "I spent 7 years in C-suite roles and realized my passion is building products, not just strategizing about them. So I taught myself to code and built 6 apps in 7 months. Now I want to join a team where I can combine both skill sets - strategic thinking AND hands-on engineering - to build AI products that scale to millions of users.",

Given my unique combination of 7 years C-suite experience plus full-stack engineering skills, I believe this is fair market value.
