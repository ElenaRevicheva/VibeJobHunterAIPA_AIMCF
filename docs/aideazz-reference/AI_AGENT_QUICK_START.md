## 🎯 INTERVIEW PREPARATION

### Common Questions & Answers

**"Tell me about yourself"**
```
"I'm an engineer and founder who combines strategic thinking with hands-on 
execution. Spent 7 years as Chief Legal Officer leading digital transformation, 
then taught myself full-stack development and built 6 production AI apps in 
7 months. What excites me most is building products that solve real problems - 
like my WhatsApp AI assistant that's live today at wa.me/50766623757. I'm 
looking for a role where I can use both my strategic experience and technical 
skills to build AI products that help millions of people."
```

**"Why this company?"**
```
[Research company thoroughly]
"I'm excited about [Company] because [specific reason 1] and [specific reason 2]. 
When I saw [specific product/feature], I immediately thought about how [specific 
technical approach]. Your focus on [their mission] aligns perfectly with my 
experience building products for underserved markets."
```

**"What's your biggest achievement?"**
```
"Building 6 production AI applications in 7 months for under $15K - a 98% cost 
reduction vs the $950K traditional estimate. But beyond the metrics, I'm most 
proud that these are real, working products solving real problems. You can try 
one right now: wa.me/50766623757. It demonstrates what I call 'founder-mode 
engineering' - strategic thinking plus hands-on execution plus relentless shipping."
```

**"Describe a technical challenge"**
```
"Integrating 8 different AI APIs with real-time voice processing was complex. 
The challenge was handling voice-to-text latency, API failures, and maintaining 
conversation context. I solved it by building a robust error handling system 
with fallbacks, implementing streaming responses, and creating a context 
management layer. The result is a production system that handles real-time 
voice conversations with 99%+ uptime."
```

**"Why leave your current role?"**
```
"I spent 7 years in C-suite roles and realized my passion is building products, 
not just strategizing about them. So I taught myself to code and built 6 apps 
in 7 months. Now I want to join a team where I can combine both skill sets - 
strategic thinking AND hands-on engineering - to build AI products that scale 
to millions of users."
```

**"Salary expectations?"**
```
"I'm looking for $100-180K base plus equity, depending on the role and company 
stage. Given my unique combination of 7 years C-suite experience plus full-stack 
engineering skills, I believe this is fair market value. But I'm flexible for 
the right opportunity, especially if there's meaningful equity."
