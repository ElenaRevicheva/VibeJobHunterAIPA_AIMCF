## 🚨 Questions?

### "How is this different from before?"
Before: Generic engineer roles, manual search, no traction mentioned.
Now: YC/AngelList founding roles, automated search, PayPal subs + 19 countries + Web3 combo emphasized!

### "Will I get blocked by scrapers?"
Maybe - but the system opens optimized searches in your browser anyway, so you just copy URLs manually (2 extra minutes).

### "How long per application?"
With full automation: **30-45 seconds per app** (just copy-paste and submit).

### "Quality vs. Quantity?"
Both! The system heavily filters (founding engineer, equity, early-stage) AND generates custom materials for each.
