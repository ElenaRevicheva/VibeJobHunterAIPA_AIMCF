## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Will automated search always work?
A: No - LinkedIn/Indeed often block scrapers. But when blocked, the system **opens optimized searches** in your browser, so you just copy URLs manually (takes 2 extra minutes).

### Q: How many applications per day?
A: 10-20 is optimal. Quality > Quantity. The system filters heavily.

### Q: What if I want to customize materials?
A: Edit files in `applications/` folder before submitting. AI gives you 90% - you can polish the 10%.

### Q: Does it auto-submit?
A: No - submission requires captchas, account logins, and custom questions. You do the final click (this is intentional to maintain quality).

### Q: Can I target specific companies?
A: Yes! Edit `src/core/candidate_data.json` → `target_companies` section.
