```bash
# Do everything automatically
python -m src.main autopilot --resume "YOUR_RESUME.pdf"
```

```bash
# Check status
python -m src.main status

# See what needs follow-up

---

## 💡 **Pro Vibe Tips**

### 1. Run Daily
```bash
# Add to your morning routine
python -m src.main autopilot --resume "resume.pdf"
```

### 2. Quality Check (30 seconds)
Before submitting, quick scan:
- ✅ Company name correct?
- ✅ Role title matches?
- ✅ Sounds like you?

If yes → Submit. Don't overthink.

### 3. Volume Wins
```
10 apps/day × 20 working days = 200 apps/month
200 apps × 5% response rate = 10 interviews
10 interviews × 30% offer rate = 3 offers
```

More shots on goal = more goals.

### 4. Track in Batches
```bash
# Weekly check
python -m src.main status
```

Don't obsess daily. Trust the process.

### 5. Follow Up Auto
```bash
# Every Monday
python -m src.main followup
```

System reminds you. Just send the emails.

## 📊 **What to Expect**

### Week 1:
- 50 applications sent
- 0-2 responses (normal, takes time)
- System learning your style

### Week 2-3:
- 50 more applications
- 2-5 responses
- First interviews

### Week 4+:
- Steady flow of applications

## 🎯 **Why This Works**

### Traditional Job Search:
```
1 hour per job × 50 jobs = 50 hours
50 hours = 6 full work days
```

### Vibe Mode:
```
15 min per day × 20 days = 5 hours total
Same 50 applications in 5 hours vs 50 hours
```

**10x faster.** That's the vibe.

## ⚠️ **Common Vibe Mistakes**

### ❌ DON'T:
- Over-engineer the system
- Manually edit every word
- Obsess over perfection
- Apply to 100 jobs/day (quality > quantity)
- Forget to follow up

### ✅ DO:
- Run autopilot daily
- Quick quality check
- Submit consistently
- Follow up weekly
- Trust the AI

---

## 🎨 **Customize (Optional)**

If you want to adjust settings, edit `src/core/config.py`:

```python
# Your target roles
target_roles = [
    "AI Engineer",
    "Founding Engineer",
    # Add yours...
]

# Minimum match score (adjust if too many/few jobs)
min_match_score = 65  # Lower = more jobs, Higher = fewer jobs

# Daily limit
MAX_DAILY_APPLICATIONS = 10  # Increase if you're on fire
```

But honestly? **Default settings are fine.** Don't overthink it.

## 🤔 **FAQ for Vibers**

### "Do I need Railway?"
**No.** Run locally. It's faster to set up.

### "Should I review every resume?"
**Quick skim only.** AI is good. Don't spend 30 min per resume.

### "What if match score is 65?"
**Apply anyway.** 65+ is worth a shot. You miss 100% of shots not taken.

### "Should I customize more?"
**No.** AI already customized it. Stop customizing the customization.

### "How many applications daily?"
**10 is perfect.** Don't burn out. Consistency > intensity.

### "What about networking?"
**Do it in parallel.** But applications are the baseline. Network = bonus.

## 🎉 **Success Formula**

```python
# The Vibe Coder Job Hunt Formula
applications_per_day = 10
days_per_week = 5
weeks = 4

total_applications = applications_per_day * days_per_week * weeks
# = 200 applications

response_rate = 0.05  # 5% (industry average)
expected_interviews = total_applications * response_rate
# = 10 interviews

offer_rate = 0.30  # 30% (if you're good)
expected_offers = expected_interviews * offer_rate
# = 3 offers

print("You'll get hired in 4-8 weeks. Trust the math.")
```

---

## 💪 **Ready?**

```bash
# Install
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Add key
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key" > .env

# GO!
