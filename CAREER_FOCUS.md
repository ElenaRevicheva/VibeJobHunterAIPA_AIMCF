## 1️⃣ CANDIDATE POSITIONING (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

I am **not** a generic AI engineer.

I am a:
- **Founder-level AI Product Engineer**
- **Autonomous Systems Architect**
- **0→1 Builder** with production systems
- **AI + Infra + Product + Go-To-Market hybrid**

### What this means in practice
- I replace **3–5 hires**
- I thrive in **small, high-autonomy teams**
- I build **systems that ship, sell, and operate**

➡️ Any role that does not value this is automatically rejected.

---

## 5️⃣ 🧠 AUTOMATION ARCHITECTURE (END-TO-END)

### A. Unified Job Intake
Sources:
- Ashby
- Greenhouse
- Lever
- Workday
- Wellfound
- YC Jobs
- Career Pages
- AI Boards

⬇️

### B. Hard Gate (PHASE 0 — MANDATORY)
A job is discarded unless ALL are true:
- Company size: **5–100**
- Stage: **Seed → Series B**
- Role contains ≥1 keyword:
  - founding
  - platform
  - product
  - automation
  - infra
- Salary ≥ regional floor
- Remote or Panama-compatible

⬇️

### C. AI Match Scoring (PHASE 2)

| Dimension | Weight |
|--------|------|
| AI product ownership | 25 |
| 0→1 autonomy | 25 |
| Full-stack / infra | 20 |
| Business exposure | 15 |
| Bilingual / global | 5 |
| Web3 (optional) | 10 |

**Rule:**  
- Score ≥ 75 → ACCEPT  
- Score < 75 → AUTO-REJECT

⬇️

### D. Resume Variant Selection (PHASE 3)

Maintain **3 resumes**:
1. Founding Engineer
2. Senior AI Product Engineer
3. AI Solutions Architect

Engine selects based on:
- Company stage
- Role language
- Technical emphasis

⬇️

### E. Contextual Application (PHASE 4)

**No generic cover letters. Ever.**

Each application answers:
> “Why should THIS company talk to ME?”

Structure:
1. Show understanding of their product
2. Map one shipped system to their pain
3. Explain fit for small, high-autonomy teams
4. Calm, confident close

3–4 paragraphs. Zero buzzwords.

⬇️

### F. Priority Order
1. Direct email (Founder / CTO / Head of AI)
2. Company careers page
3. ATS (Greenhouse / Ashby / Lever)
4. LinkedIn Easy Apply (last resort)

---

## 6️⃣ VOLUME RULES (ANTI-BURNOUT)

- **3–5 applications per day**
- **20–30 total before reassessment**

If zero interviews after 30:
- Adjust scoring
- Adjust narrative
- ❌ Do NOT increase volume

---

## 7️⃣ FINAL TRUTH

I do not need more jobs.

I need:
- Fewer
- Better
- Human-targeted
- Context-aware applications

This system is not a job board.  
It is a **precision career weapon**.

One “yes” is enough.
