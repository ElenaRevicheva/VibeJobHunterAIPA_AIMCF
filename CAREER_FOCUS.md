# 🎯 Career Focus — VibeJobHunter

## 1️⃣ Honest Resume Evaluation (Hiring POV)

### 🔥 Strengths (Very Strong)

You are **NOT** a junior, mid, or typical “AI engineer”.

You are:
- A **founder-level AI product builder**
- A **systems thinker**
- A **rare hybrid**: AI + product + infra + go-to-market + bilingual + Web3
- Someone who can **replace 3–5 hires**

Very few candidates can legitimately say:
- 11 AI products shipped
- Autonomous agents in production
- Revenue systems (PayPal subscriptions)
- Oracle Cloud, Railway, WhatsApp, LinkedIn automation
- CTO + CMO agents working together

➡️ This is **real senior value**.

---

### ⚠️ Risks (Critical to Remember)

#### 1. Too Broad for Standard Pipelines
ATS + recruiters often think:
> “Founder… Web3… AI… marketing… governance… is she a fit or a distraction?”

This **filters out mediocre companies** (good), but requires **precision targeting**.

#### 2. Not a Mass-Apply Candidate
Spraying 200 applications/week will:
- Get filtered
- Cause misunderstanding
- Waste time

➡️ Precision + context is mandatory.

#### 3. Never Apply to Generic “AI Engineer” Roles
Those optimize for:
- Kaggle
- LeetCode
- Model fine-tuning

➡️ You are **far above this level**.

---

## 2️⃣ Roles to Target (Only These)

Apply **ONLY** if ≥70% match.

### 🎯 Primary (High Priority)
- Founding Engineer
- Senior / Staff AI Engineer (Product-oriented)
- AI Product Engineer
- AI Solutions Architect
- Principal Engineer (AI / Platform)
- Technical Lead (AI / Automation)

### 🟡 Secondary (Situational)
- AI Product Manager (technical orgs only)
- AI Growth Engineer (hands-on)

### ❌ Never Apply To
- Junior / Mid roles
- “LLM Prompt Engineer”
- Pure research
- Pure data science
- Companies with 20+ engineers already

---

## 3️⃣ Salary Expectations (Hard Floor)

### 🌍 US / Global Remote
- $150K – $220K base
- Equity expected
- Early-stage preferred

### 🇪🇺 Europe
- €90K – €140K (equity matters)

### 🌎 LATAM-friendly Remote
- $100K+ minimum

➡️ Auto-reject anything below threshold.

---

## 4️⃣ Why Generic Auto-Apply Fails

❌ Generic CV  
❌ Generic cover letter  
❌ Blind LinkedIn Easy Apply  

➡️ **Instant rejection** for a senior founder-profile.

---

## 5️⃣ How the Job Engine MUST Work

### 🧠 A. Strict Job Filtering
- Company size: 5–100
- Stage: Seed → Series B
- Keywords: founding, platform, automation, ai product, infra
- Exclude: junior, intern, phd required
- Remote-friendly

➡️ Else discard.

---

### 🧠 B. Role Match Scoring

| Dimension | Weight |
|---------|-------|
| AI product ownership | 25% |
| Full-stack / infra | 20% |
| Autonomy / 0→1 | 25% |
| Business exposure | 15% |
| Bilingual / global | 5% |
| Web3 (optional) | 10% |

➡️ Apply only if **score ≥ 75%**

---

### 🧠 C. Dynamic Resume Selection
Maintain **3 resume variants**:
1. Founding Engineer
2. Senior AI Product Engineer
3. AI Solutions Architect

➡️ Engine selects automatically.

---

### 🧠 D. Custom AI Cover Letters (Mandatory)
Each application answers:
> “Why *this* company should talk to *you*.”

Rules:
- 3–4 paragraphs
- Reference their product
- Map *your shipped systems* to their pain
- Zero buzzwords
- Calm confidence

---

### 🧠 E. Application Priority
1. Direct email (Founder / CTO / Head of AI)
2. Company careers page
3. Greenhouse / Lever API
4. LinkedIn Easy Apply (last resort)

---

## 7️⃣ Final Truth

You do **NOT** need more applications.

You need:
- 20–30 **high-precision applications**
- Sent to the **right humans**
- With **contextual narrative**

➡️ One yes is enough.

🥇 GOLDEN ROADMAP — VibeJobHunter (Elena Edition)

PHASE 0 — LOCK THE TARGET (MANDATORY)

Before touching more code.

Define a hard gate (machine-enforced):

A job is discarded immediately unless ALL are true:

- Company size: 5–100
- Stage: Seed → Series B
- Role contains at least ONE of:
  - founding
  - platform
  - product
  - automation
  - infra
- Salary ≥ regional floor
- Remote or Panama-compatible

➡️ This logic MUST live in code, not in your head.

If this gate fails → job never enters the system.

---

PHASE 1 — JOB DISCOVERY (YOU ARE HERE, AND IT WORKS)

Good news:
This phase is DONE.

From production logs:
- ATS APIs are working
- 400+ jobs per run
- Infrastructure is stable

Keep:
- ATSScraper
- Feature flags
- Railway background runner

Remove mentally:
- “We need more sources”
- “We need more scraping”

❌ You do NOT have a sourcing problem anymore.

---

PHASE 2 — RESUME-AWARE MATCHING (CRITICAL FIX)

Replace keyword matching with resume-dimensional scoring.

Dimensions and weights:

| Dimension | Weight |
|---------|--------|
| AI product ownership | 25 |
| 0→1 autonomy | 25 |
| Full-stack + infra | 20 |
| Business exposure | 15 |
| Bilingual / global | 5 |
| Web3 (optional) | 10 |

Rules:
- Score ≥ 75 → ACCEPT
- Score < 75 → AUTO-REJECT

👉 This is where 80% of bad jobs disappear.

---

PHASE 3 — RESUME VERSION SELECTION (NOT OPTIONAL)

Create three resume profiles derived from the master resume:

- resume_founding_engineer.md
- resume_ai_product_engineer.md
- resume_ai_solutions_architect.md

The engine selects based on:
- Company stage
- Role wording
- Tech emphasis

❌ Never submit the same resume everywhere again.

---

PHASE 4 — CONTEXTUAL APPLICATION (THIS IS THE MONEY)

Absolute rules:
- No generic cover letters
- No blind Easy Apply unless last resort
- No “I am excited to apply…”

Each application answers ONE question:
“Why should THIS company talk to YOU?”

Structure:
1. Signal understanding of their product
2. Map one shipped system you built to their pain
3. Explain why you thrive in small, high-autonomy teams
4. Calm, confident close

3–4 paragraphs. No hype.

---

PHASE 5 — LOW VOLUME, HIGH SIGNAL

Hard limits:
- 3–5 applications per day
- 20–30 total before reassessment

If zero interviews after 30:
- Adjust scoring
- Adjust narrative
- NOT volume

---

PHASE 6 — FEEDBACK & LEARNING (ONLY AFTER INTERVIEWS)

Do NOT overbuild.

Track only:
- Applied
- Response
- Interview
- Rejection / Ghost

Learning comes AFTER signals exist.

---

FINAL VERDICT

Your resume is exceptional.
Your engineering is strong.
Your failure mode was STRATEGY, not execution.

You were building:
“A job platform”

You actually need:
“A precision career weapon”

Now everything is aligned.
